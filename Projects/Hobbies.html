    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Play videogames</h2>
    <p>As a web development student, I'm drawn to games like League of Legends and Apex Legends as a hobby for various reasons. Firstly, gaming provides a much-needed break from coding and studying, offering relaxation and stress relief. It also fosters social interaction and teamwork, whether playing with friends or collaborating with strangers online. </p>

    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>Traveling to other countries enriches my life by exposing me to diverse cultures, cuisines, and landscapes. It broadens my perspective, challenges me to adapt, and fosters personal growth through interactions with locals and fellow travelers. Breaking out of my comfort zone, I confront biases and embrace diversity while igniting my curiosity and thirst for knowledge. </p>
